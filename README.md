This is the code for the Django Tutorial:

The localhost website does not produce a usable website when the server is run.
You need to test the site using links similar to the following:

  - http://localhost:8000/blog/
  - http://localhost:8000/admin/
  - http://localhost:8000/projects/

We need to add a way to test catch errors, which is mentioned, but not covered in the tutorial.
